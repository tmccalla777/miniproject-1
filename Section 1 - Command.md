1. cd command
    * The 'cd' command is used to change the current working directory within a file system.
    * This is used to navigate the file system with the command line rather than the gui. 
    * To use this command, you must enter the command prompt. Once the command prompt is opened, type 'cd' and then the location of the desired directory. 

2. mkdir command
    * The 'mkdir' command is used to make an empty directory in the current location
    * This command will allow the user to create new directories in any location via the command prompt.
    * To use this command, you must enter the command prompt. The user must naviagte to the desired directory,
    enter 'mkdir' and then the name of the desired directory to create. Once the user presses enter, the directory
    will be created.

3. cp command
    * The 'cp' command is used to copy any number of files or a directory. 
    * This command is used to create copies of any number of files and place them in the same directory location. The same goes for a directory. This command can also be used to copy the contents of one file and overwrite another file with its contents.
    * To use this command, open the command prompt and then type 'cp', the location of the original file and the destination of the copy. FYI... If the destination location is already a file, the file contents will be overwritten.
