#  Explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company -
# What is Git?

## Git is the most popular and widely used version control system today. Originally developed as an open source project in 2005 by the creator of Linux operating system, it is a matured and actively maintained environment. A huge number of developers rely upon Git version controlling to develop several types of commercial and non-commercial projects. Git based developers are well thought of and considered as valuable resources.

# What are the advantages of Git?
## Performance - Git performs very strongly and reliably when compared to other version control systems. New code changes can be easily commited, version branches can be effortlessly compared and merged, and code can also be optimized to perform better.
## Security - Git is designed specially to maintain the integrity of source code. File contents as well as the relationship between file and directories, tags, commits, versions etc. are secured cryptographically using an algorithm called SHA1 which protects the code and change history against accidental as well as malicious damage. 
## Flexibility - A key design objective of Git is the kind of flexibility it offers to support several kinds of nonlinear development workflows and its efficiency in handling both small scale and large scale projects as well as protocols.
## Wide acceptance - Git offers the type of performance, functionality, security and flexibility that most developers and teams need to develop their projects. When compared to other VCS Git is most widely accepted system owing to its universally accepted usability and performance standards.
## Quality open source project - Git is a widely supported open source project with over ten years of operational history. People maintaining the project are very well matured and possess a long term vision to meet the long term needs of users by releasing staged upgrades at regular intervals of time to improve functionality as well as usability.
# Why use Git ?
## If your business depends heavily upon IT and software processes, or you're a software development entity, Git radically changes the way how your team will create and deliver work to you. Various processes including designing, development, product management, marketing, customer support can be easily handled and maintained using Git in your organization.
1. Feature branch workflow
## Git has powerful branching capabilities. To start work, developers have to first create a unique branch. Each branch functions in an isolated environment while changes are carried out in the codebase. This ensures that the master branch always supports production-quality code.
