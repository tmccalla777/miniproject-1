#  Explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company -
# What is Git?

## Git is the most popular and widely used version control system today. Originally developed as an open source project in 2005 by the creator of Linux operating system, it is a matured and actively maintained environment. A huge number of developers rely upon Git version controlling to develop several types of commercial and non-commercial projects. Git based developers are well thought of and considered as valuable resources.

# What are the advantages of Git?
## Performance - Git performs very strongly and reliably when compared to other version control systems. New code changes can be easily commited, version branches can be effortlessly compared and merged, and code can also be optimized to perform better.
## Security - Git is designed specially to maintain the integrity of source code. File contents as well as the relationship between file and directories, tags, commits, versions etc. are secured cryptographically using an algorithm called SHA1 which protects the code and change history against accidental as well as malicious damage. 
## Flexibility - A key design objective of Git is the kind of flexibility it offers to support several kinds of nonlinear development workflows and its efficiency in handling both small scale and large scale projects as well as protocols.
## Wide acceptance - Git offers the type of performance, functionality, security and flexibility that most developers and teams need to develop their projects. When compared to other VCS Git is most widely accepted system owing to its universally accepted usability and performance standards.
## Quality open source project - Git is a widely supported open source project with over ten years of operational history. People maintaining the project are very well matured and possess a long term vision to meet the long term needs of users by releasing staged upgrades at regular intervals of time to improve functionality as well as usability.
# Why use Git ?
## If your business depends heavily upon IT and software processes, or you're a software development entity, Git radically changes the way how your team will create and deliver work to you. Various processes including designing, development, product management, marketing, customer support can be easily handled and maintained using Git in your organization.
# 1. Feature branch workflow
## Git has powerful branching capabilities. To start work, developers have to first create a unique branch. Each branch functions in an isolated environment while changes are carried out in the codebase. This ensures that the master branch always supports production-quality code.

# 2. Distributed development 
## Since Git is a distributed VCS it offers a local repository to each developer with its own history of commits. Therefore, you don't require a network connection to create commits, inspect previous file versions, or check differences between two or more commits. Also, itâ€™s much easier to scale the team.

# 3. Pull requests
## A developer calls a pull request to ask another developer to merge one of his/her branches into the other's repository. Besides making it a lot easier for project leaders to monitor and track code changes, "pulling" also facilitates other developers to discuss their work before integrating the code with the codebase.

# 4. Community
## Git is very popular, widely used, and accepted as standard version control system by the vast majority within the developer's community. It's much easier to leverage 3rd-party libraries and encourage other developers to fork your open source code using Git. The sheer number of Git users make it easy to resolve issues and seek outside help using online forums.

# Docker
## Docker, an organization which galvanized the containerization movement by delivering lightweight container technology that makes it easy for development and IT teams to build, ship and run applications, irrespective of the infrastructure, whether Windows, Linux or mainframe, on premise or in the cloud. 
## The industry reports say that by implementing Docker EE, businesses are accelerating application delivery by almost 13 times and achieving cost-savings of near about 50 percent. The MTA program of Docker enables enterprises to containerize legacy applications without touching source code in fewer than five days. As a result of such a system, organizations are experiencing significant cost-savings and the application gain greater security and efficiencies, while becoming a portable to hybrid cloud environments. Organizations can in turn use these cost savings to fund modernization projects and digital transformation programs using Docker Enterprise Edition at the heart of these initiatives.
## Not only does Docker generate cost-savings and efficiency for enterprises, but the platform is also known to deliver robust security across the entire software supply chain. 
## Additionally, Docker is certified against a variety of infrastructure platforms which ensures that Docker applications will run on any platform as mentioned above without any necessary code change. This is a key enabler of hybrid cloud as containerized applications are truly portable and enterprises can easily move applications across public and private clouds using Docker Enterprise Edition.
